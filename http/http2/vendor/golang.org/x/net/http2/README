This was the old home of Go's HTTP/2 implementation.

It now lives in the Go repo.

I'm keeping this tree working for now, but please update your imports
to:

    import "golang.org/x/net/http2"

Godoc is:

    https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2

http2 is enabled by default in Go 1.6+ with no changes to your
code. Unless you're doing something weird, you should not need to
import golang.org/x/net/http2.

The code is now at:

    https://go.googlesource.com/net/ (main repo)
    ... in directory https://go.googlesource.com/net/+/master/http2/

Github mirror:
    https://github.com/golang/net/tree/master/http2 (mirror)

Bugs should be filed in Go's main bug tracker:

    https://golang.org/s/http2bug

Now that it's on Gerrit, we no longer use Github's pull requests and
are using Gerrit instead for code review. Contribution instructions:
